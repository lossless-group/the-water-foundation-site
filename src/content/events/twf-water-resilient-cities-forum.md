invite_message: "Meet us at the TWF Water Resilient Cities Forum, The Water Foundation’s flagship forum for the Global Majors Water-Resilient Cities Leadership Alliance.\n\nHosted in Cape Town on 21 November 2025 on the eve of G20, the Forum brings together mayors, city leaders and capital providers to explore how cities can strengthen water resilience, from governance and infrastructure to innovative finance.\n\nWater infrastructure and innovation ecosystems have always determined both the limits and possibilities of water resilience, from Roman aqueducts to the water systems of the Indus and Mayan civilisations, and this Forum is designed to translate that historic lesson into practical cooperation and capacity building for today’s urban systems."
