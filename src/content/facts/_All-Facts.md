1. Water is one of the few essential sectors without a global capital stack.
Energy has oil markets. Tech has VC. Water — the most fundamental input to life and economy — still lacks coordinated early-stage capital or infrastructure buy-in.

24. Water is heavier than oil — and often more expensive.
Fact: A litre of water weighs ~1 kg, while a litre of crude oil weighs ~0.8–0.9 kg. Bottled water is frequently more expensive than petrol in many regions.
