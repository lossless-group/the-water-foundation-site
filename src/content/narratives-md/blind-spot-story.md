## _Water as the defining Critical Resource of the 21st Century_

> The Water Foundation is set up to tackle ta core blind spot of humankind: 
>                             **WATER**

The unrecognised consequences of current and future water availability and access. 

_Due to the blind spot_ 

- **Enormous Financing Mismatch:** 90% of climate adaptation needs are water-based, YET less than - 5% of climate finance is directed toward water.
- **Severe Resilience Gap:** Many governments and organisations have a wide-open weak spot in their water strategies and their systematic implementation.
- **Large Asset Neglect:** Water assets are underpriced, fragmented and underprotected.
- **Critical Systemic Fallout:** Water issues such as scarcity, pollution, or mismanagement will have deep social, political, and ethical consequences.
- **Shortage:** Water is a limited resource, with freshwater representing only about 3% of all water on Earth.
- **The Water Foundation (TWF)** is stepping up to fill this gap at a systems level: utilizing systems level & first principles thinking.
