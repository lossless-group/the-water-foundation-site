# Funds as Instruments

Impact and Transformative Venture are hamstrung by siloed realities. They only manage whatever kind of instrument or vehicle that they manage, they almost never have more than one fund structure instrument. Why?  It's the way the industry grew up. It has always been. No other reason.  

Progress is slow because ideas, practices, partnerships, and opportunities are not cross-pollinating quickly enough between different firms that manage different fund structures, their partners and their backers.

We believe funds are instruments of change. And we need a symphony of instruments to create the change we need.

What we need is more Open Innovation, not at the conference and media level, but at the tactical and procedural level.

# A Primer on Open Innovation and Network Capital

Open Innovation is the belief and strategy that prioritizes the importance of external ideas, practices, and opportunities in driving innovation and growth. It recognizes that innovation is not a closed system, but rather a dynamic process that benefits from the exchange of ideas and knowledge across different organizations, sectors, industries, and even countries.

Network Capital is the belief and strategy that more value is created by the exchange of ideas and knowledge across different organizations, sectors, industries, and even countries, than by small teams of elite professionals working in relative isolation.

# Our Network Capital Approach

(A diagram that illustrates the concept below.)
1. Different fund structures will be managed by one professional with a track record of managing that fund structure. They will be supported by and accountable to a small group of trustees with long track records of success in that fund structure. 

2. Trustees will be responsible for ensuring that the fund is managed in a way that aligns with the fund's mission and values, as well as generates outstanding returns relative to alternatives, both impact and financial.

3. Managing Partners and their Trustees will provide transparency and information to convenings of our unified boards and network.

4. We will introduce the idea of Mission Boards. These will be advisory board member that sign up to oversee our collective impact on a specific challenge or mission. One Mission Board member will both convene and manage that Mission Board, but will also serve as an organizatino wide Director. All Board of Directors meetings will be public and archived (save executive sessions), and all Mission Board members will be invited to these meetings as Observers.

5. Managing Partners of different fund structures are expected to use this committed and expansive network to form coalitions and partnerships to address these specific challenges or missions, as well as be recruited by Mission Boards to form such coaltions or partnerships, to commit to aligned goals or outcomes, or to pursue aligned investment theses.  

6. The Water Foundation is the umbrella organization that initializes, galvanizes, and coordinates the activities of our fund instruments, their Managing Partners and Trustees, and the Mission Boards.
