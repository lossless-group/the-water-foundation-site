Where water security is achieved, peace, socio-political stability and health follows.

Where resilience is built by a water tech solution ecosystem, returns stabilize and become sustainable.

And where water circularity drives productivity, prosperity scales - both in impact and investment potential.

Water is quickly becoming the world’s most critical resource. As scarcity and contamination rise, so does the urgency for bold, scalable solutions.

In 2024, investor interest surged in technologies like desalination, advanced treatment, and PFAS destruction — solutions that are vital for environmental resilience and rich with market potential.

This is more than a crisis. It’s a call to invest in the future - where innovation meets impact.

As global water challenges intensify, from increasing scarcity to emerging contaminants, the demand for breakthrough technologies in water treatment and management is rising. 

In 2024 alone, investor interest in water innovation surged across key areas like desalination, advanced wastewater treatment, and PFAs destruction. These technologies are critical for environmental resilience and present high-growth market opportunities for innovators and stakeholders in the water sector.

What began as an improbable group of systems thinkers finding each other at COP30, grew into a targeted global initiative. We bring together exceptional people who are impatient with the way things are, embrace new ways of systems thinking across the water cycle and along the water tech stack - and have the courage to act.

The Water Foundation empowers individuals, organisations, and states to develop strategic capacity, increase resilience, and shape circular water and resource infrastructures for the future - through knowledge, cooperation, and systemic innovation.

We develop water strategies and solutions across the water cycle and for each and every water challenge. We enable the research, development and scaling of new or hidden technologies.

We build an ecosystem that addresses one of the least appreciated challenges of our time: water scarcity and impending degradation of our water systems.
